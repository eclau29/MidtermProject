1,Rainbow Trout,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/RainbowTrout_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Rainbows can be found in most mountain lakes and streams, as well as many plains reservoirs. Physical characteristics that can help distinguish rainbow trout include dark spots on a light body, continuous spotting throughout the body, and often a \“rainbow\” horizontal reddish stripe. Rainbow trout may be caught with a variety of flies, baits, and lures.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_trout,,
2,Cutthroat (Native) Trout,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/CutThroatTrout_JosephTomerelli.jpg,Cutthroat trout can be distinguished from rainbows by heavier spotting toward the tail and the presence of a red slash on their \“throat.\” Anglers may find these trout in high lakes and streams.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_trout,,
3,Brown Trout,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/BrownTrout_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"These fish can be difficult to catch, but many anglers have good success during their fall spawning runs. A large dark spotting pattern and reddish dots can help anglers distinguish these fish from rainbows and cutthroats.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_trout,,
4,Brook Trout,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/BrookTrout_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Brook trout have white spots (worm-shaped on top) on a dark background with tri-colored outlined fins (orange, black and white).They are typically found in higher elevation lakes, beaver dams and streams.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_trout,,
5,Lake Trout,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/LakeTrout_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Also known as Mackinaw. They have white spots on a dark background with a deep fork in their tail. As the name suggests, these fish are found in mountain lakes and are usually in deeper water. Anglers also enjoy success with this species during the fall and spring in shallower areas and when ice-fishing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_trout,,
6,Kokanee Salmon,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Kokanee_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"These silver fish with black spots on the upper half of their bodies can be found  swimming in compact schools feeding on zooplankton, a food source unaffected by the drawing down of reservoirs. They turn reddish in color and males develop a \“hook jaw\” during the fall spawning season. Trolling with cowbells at medium depths provides angling success.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokanee_salmon,,
7,Mountain Whitefish,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/mountainWhiteFish_JosephTomerelli.jpg,These fish have larger scales than trout and still possess an adipose fin (small flap of skin on their back toward the tail). A weak mouth means delicate hooking and handling is required to land this fish.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_whitefish,,
8,Splake,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Splake_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Splake have tri-colored pelvic fins like brook trout and their tails are slightly forked. Splake are found in high mountains lakes and have been used since the 1980s to thin out stunted brook trout populations. Anglers relish their large sizes (up to 18 pounds) and find success with flies, lures and bait during the summer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splake,,
9,Grayling,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Grayling_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"A large sail-like dorsal fin extending over their silver bodies make them easy to identify. Grayling have extremely small mouths and can usually only be caught on small flies or lures. Even though grayling are relatively small in stature (usually less then 12 inches), they can be a nice challenge to anglers",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_grayling,,
10,Wiper,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Wiper_JosephTomerelli.jpg,Wiper have become a very popular sportfish because of their hard fighting. Wiper are a schooling fish that can be found \“busting\” prey fish on the surface during the summer. Casting shad imitations or various lures at the \“busting\” prey and holding on tight is a fun method for catching wiper. Trolling can also be effective.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_striped_bass,,
11,Walleye,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Walleye_JosephTomerelli.jpg,You can identify walleye by looking for their two separate dorsal fins and a white tipped tail. Adults feed entirely on other fish and are most often caught by slowly cranking jigs and spinners over bottom structures.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walleye,,
12,Saugeye,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Saugeye_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Saugeye can be distinguished from walleyes by black mottling marks on their bodies, tails that do not have a white tip and black pigmentation in between dorsal spines. Anglers have luck catching saugeye by trolling live bait or slowly retrieving jigs over bottom humps and points.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauger,,
13,Yellow Perch,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/YellowPerch_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Yellow perch have two separate dorsal fins with large vertical dark stripes on their yellowish sides. These fish can be found in large schools and are caught by using bait or small spinners. Yellow perch are usually less than one pound, but can be found over two pounds in some waters.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch,,
14,Channel Catfish,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/ChannelCatfish_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"These fish are easily identified by their barbels (whiskers), forked tail and sporadic black spotting. Night fishing with live bait, chicken innards, flavored dough balls, or any other smelly concoction provides the best angling success. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_catfish,,
15,Smallmouth Bass,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/SmallMouthBass_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"The best way to distinguish the smallmouth from its cousin, the largemouth bass, is by the \“smallies\” jaws that does not extend beyond the eye. They maintain broken vertical lines on their sides and many have a reddish eye. Smallies are frequently caught along rip-rap shorelines with small jigs or crayfish imitations",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallmouth_bass,,
16,Largemouth Bass,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/LargeMouth_JosephTomerelli.jpg,This fish has a very big mouth and its jaw extends past the eye. You can also distinguish them as the bass with the horizontal stripe on their body. Casting lures and plugs during dawn and dusk hours around cattails and sunken logs will give you the best chance to land one of the lunkers.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largemouth_bass,,
17,Tiger Muskie (Muskellunge),https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/TigerMuskie_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Their long snout filled with teeth and dark tiger striped sides on a light body make them easy to identify. The best opportunity to catch a tiger muskie would be by throwing large lures over vegetation during the summer. Northern pike look like tiger muskie, but have whitish irregular chain markings on a dark body.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_muskellunge,,
18,Black Crappie,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/BlackCrappie_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"Crappie are a pan-shaped fish with black splotches on a silver background, whose dorsal spines and rays get longer as they approach the tail. Crappie are a schooling fish that often congregate around vertical structures. Anglers have the most success for crappies jigging by structure in the early spring. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_crappie,,
19,Bluegill,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/BlueGill_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"The bluegill has a small mouth on a short head and a dark gill flap with no trim. There are parallel vertical bars on the side with long, pointed pectoral (side) fins. A male bluegill in breeding colors has brilliant blue fins and a red-orange stomach. The female bluegill is dark on the back with vertical stripes on the body. Bluegills are best caught in the morning or evening using small tackle ranging from a bobber and worm to delicate dry flies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegill,,
20,Green Sunfish,https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/GreenSunfish_JosephTomerelli.jpg,"This fish is similar in appearance to the bluegill, but has a larger mouth and is olive in color with short, rounded pectoral fins and yellow trim on the fins. This stocky fish is found in both streams and impoundments and spawns in shallow areas from June to mid-August. Like most sunfish, this sporty panfish can be taken with crickets, worms, and other bait rigged under a bobber, or with small lures, jigs, and flies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sunfish,,
21,Colorado Pikeminnow (Protected),https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Pikeminnow_JosephTomerelli_low.jpg,"Protected fish. The Colorado pikeminnow is the largest minnow in North America and is an endangered, native fish of the Colorado River thought to have evolved more than 3 million years ago. 

Called the \“white salmon\” by early settlers due to its migratory behavior, the Colorado pikeminnow has a torpedo-shaped body and a large, toothless mouth. It has an olive-green and gold back and a silvery-white belly. ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_pikeminnow,,
22,Humpback Chub (Protected),https://cpw.state.co.us/PublishingImages/Fishing/SpeciesID/Humpback_JosephTomerelli_low.jpg,"Protected fish.
